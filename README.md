🏡 Task-5: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression – Oasis Infobyte Internship 📊

As part of my Oasis Infobyte Data Science & Machine Learning Internship, I successfully completed Task-5, focusing on Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression in Python.

📌 Project Overview:

The aim of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of estimating house prices based on multiple factors such as location, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and more. Using a real-world dataset, I followed the end-to-end machine learning workflow.

🛠 Steps Involved:

🔹 Data Understanding & Cleaning – Checked for missing values, corrected data types, and explored data patterns.
🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized relationships between features and price using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
🔹 Feature Engineering – Handled categorical variables via One-Hot Encoding to make the data ML-ready.
🔹 Model Training – Applied Linear Regression using Scikit-learn to learn relationships between features and target prices.
🔹 Model Evaluation – Measured performance using MSE, RMSE, and R² score to ensure accuracy and reliability.
🔹 Insights – Identified top factors influencing house prices and visualized Actual vs Predicted Prices.

💡 Outcome:

The model demonstrated strong predictive capability, offering valuable insights for the real estate sector. This project enhanced my understanding of regression models, data preprocessing, and evaluation techniques, which are vital in the field of data science.
